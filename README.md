## non code but yet good technical knowledge:
### Course: Blockchain and Bitcoin Fundamentals
1. in 2022, every block mined in 10 min,
to be able to tamper one block, and mine the rest of the chain, you need to be faster than the rest of the network, AKA 51% of world's hashing power
2. four leading zeros in hash checking is related to difficulty level
3. now you know why they name it *blockchain*, so n-th block = block number (n) + nonce + data + n-1 th block, you cannot change the entanglement
4. **Nonce** stands for number used once, obviously a sequence of number appeared once, and yeah only once, this is like a seed to a hash, tend to be secret

### Course: Use Ethereum, Solidity, and Smart Contracts to build production-ready apps based on the blockchain
1. Smart contract: Piece of code that lives in Ethereum blockchain
2. Like academic papers? You can read
[Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)
or
[Ethereum: The Ultimate Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform](http://web.archive.org/web/20131228111141/http://vbuterin.com/ethereum.html)
